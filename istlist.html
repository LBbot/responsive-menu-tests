		<div class = images1><h2 id="1">Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn</h2></div>
		<p>A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and macOS. It was developed and published by Square Enix, with Naoki Yoshida as producer and director, and was released worldwide on August 27, 2013. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn takes place in the fictional land of Eorzea, five years after the events of the original release. At the conclusion of Final Fantasy XIV, the primal dragon Bahamut escapes from its lunar prison to initiate the Seventh Umbral Calamity, an apocalyptic event which destroys much of Eorzea. Through the gods' blessing, the player character escapes the devastation by time traveling five years into the future. As Eorzea recovers and rebuilds, the player must deal with the impending threat of invasion by the Garlean Empire from the north.</p>
		<p>The original Final Fantasy XIV was released in September 2010 to overwhelmingly negative reviews. As a result of this poor reception, then-Square Enix President Yoichi Wada announced that a new team, led by Yoshida, would take over development of the title. This team was responsible for generating content for the original version as well as developing a brand new game which would address all of the previous release's criticisms. Initially dubbed "Version 2.0", Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn features a new engine, improved server structures, revamped gameplay and interface, and a new story.</p>

		<div class = images4><h2 id="4">NieR: Automata</h2></div>
		<p>An open-world action role-playing video game developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows. The game was released in Japan in February 2017, and worldwide the following month. Nier: Automata is a sequel to the 2010 video game Nier, a spin-off of the Drakengard series. Set in the midst of a proxy war between machines created by otherworldly invaders and the remnants of humanity, the story follows the battles of a combat android, her companion, and a fugitive prototype. Gameplay combines role-playing elements with action-based combat and mixed genre gameplay similar to that of Nier.</p>
		<p>Production began in 2014, with series creator Yoko Taro, producer Yosuke Saito, and composers Keiichi Okabe and Keigo Hoashi returning to their respective roles, as well as Square Enix artist Akihiko Yoshida in charge of character design. The story was based around themes similar to Yoko's earlier works, such as people's impulse to kill, while also incorporating issues such as confronting of prejudice and escaping difficult situations. The goal was to make a Nier game true to the spirit of the original, while simultaneously crafting better gameplay combat. As a project entirely new to the developers, the staff at PlatinumGames faced multiple challenges when developing its gameplay and open world environment.</p>
		<p>Upon release, Nier: Automata was met with generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's narrative, characterization, thematic depth, music design, combat system, and mixture of different gameplay genres, as well as its usage of the video game medium to tell its story. Criticism was leveled at the game's technical problems, visuals, and repetitive gameplay areas.</p>
